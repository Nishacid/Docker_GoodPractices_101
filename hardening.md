# Hardening a Docker Contaniner

## Docker Daemon Exposed

You need to create a specific user for docker usage, without any other permissions, and **DON'T USE** this user for anything other docker.

Don't give the **docker** group at any user unless the specific user.

Same inside a container if you'r using docker inside docker.

## Configure the user inside the container 

By defaut, the user created by docker is `root`, but if you setup a webserver the service will run as root. Imagine an attacker managed to get a access to you container, he will have root permissions inside.
So don't forget good practices outside containers inside !


## Docker Seccomp 

Secure computing mode (`seccomp`) is a Linux kernel feature. You can use it to restrict the actions available within the container. The `seccomp()` system call operates on the seccomp state of the calling process. You can use this feature to restrict your applicationâ€™s access.

This feature is available only if Docker has been built with `seccomp` and the kernel is configured with `CONFIG_SECCOMP` enabled.

For example, we can deny the container the ability to perform actions such as using the mount namespace or any of the [Linux system calls](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/).
